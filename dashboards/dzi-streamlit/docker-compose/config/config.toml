# NB: The default streamlit config.toml file contains a lot of commented options
#     This file is a stripped version where it is easier to see what actually
#     settings are with non-default values.
#
#     One can generate default config file by running `streamlit config show`
#
# NB: The file is not included in the docker image, it should be mounted when
#     the container is created.
