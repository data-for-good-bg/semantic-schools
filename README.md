# semantic-schools

This project aims at building and maintaining a [RDF Knowledge Graph](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph/) of up-to date data related to the Bulgarian education system 

## Project Structure 

The project is structured as follows 

* The SPARQL Endpoint is situated at: <http://schools.ontotext.com/data> `repository:schools`
* The [model](model) folder contains the semantic data model, and illustrates the structure of the Knowledge Graph.
* The [vocab](vocab) folder contains the ontology and vocabulary building.

* The [analysis](analysis) folder contains queries and analytics on top of the KG. 

# Objectives

<b>The specific problem we are tackling is…</b>

The unavailability, fragmentation, overall poor quality, and limited culture of usage of public
education data. Thus, sub-optimal decisions and poor resource allocation limit Bulgaria’s
knowledge economy.

<b>To counter this problem, we...</b>

Design, build, continuously populate and maintain a data-centric infrastructure and public
Knowledge Graph integrating all relevant data related to Bulgarian school system. The data will
be published as five-star linked-data.

<b>If successful, in five years the impact of our project will be...</b>

The go-to data source for education research and good policy decisions & for deep insights into
the local education environment; a best practice on regional and European level.
